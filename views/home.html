    <p>
        Check out the following helpful projects.  They are all part of this boilerplate.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/mixdown/server" target="_blank">Mixdown Server</a>: Server and entry point for web site or service.  Not required for a CLI project.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/mixdown/plugins" target="_blank">Mixdown Plugins</a>: Common plugins for websites.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/mixdown/pipelines" target="_blank">Mixdown Pipelines</a>: Common task pipelines for handling request.  Pipelines are not required with mixdown, but they are very helpful for sequencing plugin actions.  Think of them as Controllers if you like.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/tommydudebreaux/pipeline" target="_blank">Node Pipeline</a>: Lightweight task sequencing for handling complex async sequences of operations.  Similar to async.waterfall, but with a more expressive inteface and more event emitter feedback.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/vast-eng/broadway-handlebars" target="_blank">Broadway Handlebars</a>: Broadway / Mixdown plugin for using the Handlebars template engine.  Contains factory support and a few enhancements to helpers.  This will also work clientside as a plugin.</li>
    </ul>
